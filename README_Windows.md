This Python and Selenium-based bot automates applying to jobs using the Easy Apply feature on LinkedIn.

## Key Features

- Consider this an educational project.

## Getting Started

1. Modify the `config.py` file locally to include your LinkedIn credentials, personal information, and job preferences.

2. Ensure Python is installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Install the required dependencies. Open a Command Prompt (or Windows Terminal) and run the following commands:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the bot by executing:
`python main.py`
